;;; Commentary:

;; Inserts a table to track word count. With 'org-tt-status' you can get
;; current status. With 'org-tt-write' you can writ to table.

;; The code from for the actual word count is taking from Simon Guest's
;; org.el (https://github.com/dato/org-wc/blob/master/org-wc.el)

;; Some of the code to display status is taken from Lit Wakefield's
;; chronicler.el (https://github.com/noctuid/chronicler)
